          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we are committed to
          making science accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p class="short-p">
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
        </p>
        <p class="short-p">
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
        </p>
        <p class="long-p">
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life, apart from the dinosaur exhibits: they
          only come to life at night when everyone has gone home.

          <p>
            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there is plenty to see and do.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
            not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
            exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
            sure you come ready to learn and explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you will get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
            the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them.

          <p>
            Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
            facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for
            a visit.

            Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and
            academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our
            resources and contribute towards them. We have online records,
            laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of
            universities around the country.
