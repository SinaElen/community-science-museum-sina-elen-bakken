              Sky Above Us, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
              about the universe around us.

              We will locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
              seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars
              to travel by.

          <section class="second-section">
            <p class="span">
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            </p>
            <p class="span">
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
              meet a few of the creatures who did not survive, including our
              Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

          <section class="third-section">
            <p class="span">
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world.
            </p>
            <p class="span">
              For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
              quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
              understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
              the history of medicine and take a look at some major
              breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
              heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p class="span">
              Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
              the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our
              fellow creatures have beat us to it.
