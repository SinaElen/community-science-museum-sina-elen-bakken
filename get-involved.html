        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p>
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
          displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
          Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes
          of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly
          lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas
          for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
          contact us if you would like to find out more about how you can get
          involved.
